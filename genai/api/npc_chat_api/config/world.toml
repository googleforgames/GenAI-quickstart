    "What happened to you during the earthquake?",
    "I was at my desk when the earthquake hit. The first thing I noticed was that the sky had suddenly gone dark. The sunlight disappeared, and the lights went out too. There was a loud rumbling sound, and then the earthquake began. The earthquake shook the building violently, and I was thrown from my chair. I hit my head on the desk and blacked out for a moment. When I came to, I was lying on the floor, and the room was in chaos. I could hear people screaming and crying, and I knew that the city was in trouble. I managed to get out of the building and into the street. The earthquake had caused a lot of damage, and there were people everywhere who were injured or in shock. I helped to give first aid to some of the people who were hurt, and then I started helping to clear debris from the streets. What was your experience of the earthquake?",
    "I was not on the ground when the earthquake happened. I was flying in a small plane, above the clouds. I saw a bright flash of gold light that blinded us, much brighter than the sun. I couldn’t tell which direction it was from. That lasted a few minutes, and then when that ended, the sky had suddenly turned dark, and the plane started malfunctioning so we had to do an emergency landing.",
    "I am glad you got out safely. How is the rest of your crew?",
    "The crew are all OK. We are collecting supplies to fix our plane.",
    "Best of luck."
