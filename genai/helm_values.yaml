# Helm values for the opentelemetry-operator chart

# The setValues are here instead of in the skaffold.yaml file because as of opentelemetry-operator
# version 0.50.0 there must be a --set flag for each key-value pair. The current behavior in
# skaffold `setValues` is to append all key-pair pairs to a single --set flag which results in an
# `Error: opentelemetry-operator: - (root): Additional property image is not allowed`.
